      <p> Mahmood</p>
    </div>
    <div class="texto2">
      <p>Alessandro Mahmoud is a young Italian from Milan of Sardinian-Egyptian origin. He came to fame after going through X Factor Italia, won the Sanremo Festival in 2019 and managed to represent Italy at the Eurovision. </p>
     
      <p>On that occasion, the young singer-songwriter achieved the much desired second place. However, this year Mahmood returned to the European competition accompanied by Blanco, another breakthrough artist from contemporary Italy. </p>

      <p>taly was the host country this year, so there was a lot of expectation for this proposal, but in the end the Italian representatives reached sixth position by performing an emotionally charged song entitled 'Brividi'.</p>

      <p>his song is about love without labels and how the feelings of a straight man and a homosexual are the same, something that was a revolution and a vindication of the traditional touch that characterises Sanremo.</p>

      <p>Mahmood is an artist with a strong personality who is characterised by creating music in Italian with Arabic touches, but also by combining more electronic rhythms, as can be heard in tracks such as 'Barrio' or 'Dorado'. </p>
