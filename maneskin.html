      <p> Maneskin</p>

      <p>From Danish, 'moonlight'. This Italian group was born in Rome in 2016 and consists of Damiano David on vocals, Victoria de Angelis on bass, Thomas Raggi on guitar and Ethan Torchio on drums. </p>
     
      <p>The group rose to prominence in 2017 after participating in the TV show The X Factor, where they won second place. This made them famous and they released their first studio album 'Il ballo de la vita'.</p>

      <p>In 2021, they performed at the Sanremo Festival, where they managed to win and thus represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest. The young Italians also managed to win the Eurovision Song Contest with the song 'Zitti e buoni'.</p>

      <p>Today, their fame has taken them all over the world, as one of the most recognised contemporary rock groups, with global success and without ceasing to break new records.</p>

      <p>In Spain, the best known rock groups are not as young as Maneskin, so there is no main reference in this sense. However, the Italian group also has some songs that are much more emotional and far from the usual rock.</p>
