      <p>We are both young music lovers who spend most of our days listening to and sharing music with friends. We share some musical tastes, but we don't share many others, so when it comes to recommending songs and artists, the list can be very long.</p>

      <p>I am a cheerful girl and when it comes to listening to music I like ballads and above all less commercial pop and indie. Intimate songs with lyrics with a message will definitely be on my list of recommendations.
Despite my preference for this style of music, I also like to do outdoor sports, such as running, so music with rhythm is also a must. I also really enjoy Italian nightlife, so I sing along to the latest songs that can be heard everywhere, just like an Italian.
Without a doubt, the experience of living in Italy for a year has helped me to discover how special and beautiful this country is. Moreover, using music as a tool to learn Italian has made me discover great Italian talents that are now essential in my playlist, such as Coez or Ernia. </p>

      <p> I'm a very fun-loving and outgoing guy, so I never run out of conversation and music is a topic I like to share with friends. As for my musical tastes, pop is the main thing I listen to, for example Mahmood or Laura Pausini.
Thanks to studying journalism and being in a music magazine I have had the opportunity to cover several concerts in Madrid, and that is why live music is something I am passionate about, feeling more than just the music, the experience and everything that surrounds the moment of listening to many people shouting the same song at the same time.
Another subject that I also like a lot is the world of Eurovision, the following of the artists and the election festivals of each one of the representatives. That's why I followed the San Remo festival on TV. But without a doubt, one of the best experiences of the Erasmus was going to Turin to see Eurovision and live the adrenaline of watching it from the city itself. Although we couldn't watch it from the stadium itself, we were able to see it in a garden where they had set up a stage and many televisions so that a large number of people could watch it. A night that I will never forget and not only because of the great performance of both Spain and Italy. </p>
