      <p>Ana Mena Rojas is a 25-year-old Spanish singer and actress. The young woman became known in Spain in 2006 through a television show, however her breakthrough in the world of music took place in 2016, to later publish her only album to date titled Index. </p>
     
      <p>Despite having only one album, the artist had already collected several national hits with singles such as "Ella misma". For the Spanish artist, Italy is a special country, a country she is very fond of and with which she has a history, as she made her leap to fame in Italy, when her song D'Estate non vale, with the artist Fred De Palma, led her to reach number one in Italy, which has now become her second home. </p>

      <p>His latest feat was to take part in the San Remo Festival and, despite not winning, the song he presented went viral on TikTok and, on 4 March, his Spanish version was released under the title Cuando la noche arriba (When the night rises). </p>

      <p>Almost seven million monthly listeners and songs such as A un paso de la luna, which have more than 90 million plays, make her one of the most listened to Spanish songs on Spotify. In fact, she topped this Spanish podium for several months in 2021, overtaking Rosal√≠a herself.</p>


      <p>Ana Mena has become one of the great phenomena of recent years, both in Spain and abroad. She sets the pace, not only in the charts, but also in terms of style with the latest Louis Vuitton collection.</p>
